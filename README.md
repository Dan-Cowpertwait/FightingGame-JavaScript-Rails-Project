Javascript Project with Rails - FlatIron School

Welcome to my little fighting game, written in a Ruby on Rails back-end and a JS front end!

To start the application, open the back-end folder (make sure you have ruby on rails installed!) and run 'rails s' to start the server

Once the server is running, open your file explorer and navigate to the Front-End folder.

Inside you'll find the index.html file, double click and create your character!

Good luck in your battles!
